        <p>I am Ryan Gosling, a Canadian actor and musician known for my versatile talents in the entertainment industry. Born on November 12, 1980, in London, Ontario, I embarked on my career at a young age, starting with Disney's "The Mickey Mouse Club" in the early '90s. Over the years, I've gained recognition for my roles in films such as "The Notebook," "La La Land," and "Drive," earning critical acclaim and multiple award nominations. Outside of acting, my passion for music led me to form the band Dead Man's Bones and release an album. With a dedication to my craft and a love for storytelling, I continue to thrive in the world of entertainment.
